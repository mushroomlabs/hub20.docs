The idea for Hub20 started taking shape during my time working on
[Raiden](https://raiden.network), due to the frustration of dealing
with all the system's complexity and the work required to get a
running, working node. "If even the people working on the system have
such a hard time to get it working, how can we expect this to be
accessible for the general public?"

Truth be told, this is not an issue exclusive to Raiden. The absolute
majority of web3 projects are still in their infancy and the
technology is still far from being an accessible topic.
