1. **What is Hub20?**

    Hub20 is a free/open source, self-hosted payment gateway and
    wallet which allows you to make/receive payments in any
    cryptocurrency available on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides
    functionality that allows people to accept payments online
    privately and securely, without any dependency on banks or credit
    card processors or any kind of middle-man.


1.  **Is it practical to make payments in the blockchain? Transactions
    are slow and expensive, aren't they?**

    Yes, with so many people learning about Ethereum and more
    applications being developed on top of it, the network has been
    congested and even simple operations can cost tens of dollars.

    To alleviate this problem, every instance of Hub20 also
    incorporates a [Raiden](https://raiden.network) node, which allows
    great transfer throughput and virtually free transfers.


1. **Is Hub20 a Custodial Wallet?**

    The short answer would be *"Yes, users of any instance do not have
    access to the keys and have to trust the hub operator."*.

    The more elaborate answer is Hub20 is designed with a very clear
    trade-off between trustlessness and usability. Hub20 is designed to be
    used by tech-savvy *operators* who want to provide a wallet for users
    who have some sort of "real-world" trust relationship.
