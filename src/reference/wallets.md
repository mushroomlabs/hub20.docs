## Wallet models

- `ethereum_money.models.ColdWallet`: only stores addresses and can
  not be used to sign transactions. Can not be generated by hub20
  programatically. Operators need to provide the addresses.

- `ethereum_money.models.KeystoreAccount`: each model generates its
  own private key and stores it in the database. The address from the
  account is determined upon wallet generation.

- `ethereum_money.models.WhierachicalDeterministicWallet`: based on
  [eth_wallet](https://pypi.org/project/eth-wallet/), each new wallet
  is generated from the seed phrase that needs to be provide by the
  operators as part of the Hub settings. No private key is stored in
  the database, but the application needs to have access to seed
  phrase or it won't be able to generate new wallets.


## Implementing new wallet models

All wallet classes *must* inherit from
`hub20.apps.ethereum_money.models.BaseEthereumAccount` and provide the following interface:

#### Class Methods

- `generate(cls)`: creates a new model. It should raise `TypeError` in
  case the model if new wallets can not be generated by the class


#### Object properties

 - `private_key_bytes`: this property should return `bytes` representing the private key
 - `private_key`: hex string representing the private key
