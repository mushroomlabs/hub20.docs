This section contains technical reference and information that might
be useful for developers who are looking for adding improvements or
making changes to the codebase of Hub20.

First and foremost, it should be noted that Hub20 is an application
that depends on established python application frameworks such as
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/) and
[Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/reference/index.html),
so if these might be also of interest.

For Hub20-specific information, take a look at the links below:
