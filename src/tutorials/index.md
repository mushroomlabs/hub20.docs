The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed mostly at
those who are setting up and/or operating a Hub20 instance. They
assume *intense* familiarity with how Ethereum works as well as any
interaction with other systems (e.g, Raiden).

This section is meant to take you step-by-step though some key aspects
of the work needed to keep an instance operating and serving your
users. They are not meant to explore [topics in
depth](../topics/index.md) or provide [reference
material](../reference/index.md), but should leave you with a good
idea of how to get everything working.

If you are just looking about how to use the connect to an
already existing instance of Hub20 and use functions provided by it,
please refer to the [Users Manual](../manual/index.md).

The tutorials follow a logical progression, starting on how to create
ethereum accounts that will be used by the server until you have
your instance capable of processing payments through both the
blockchain as well as the integrated Raiden node.
